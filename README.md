# cat-doorbell
Programmable Arduino based delayed motion triggered wireless doorbell
<br>
Copy your regular 433Mhz doorbell clicker's signal with a push of a button.<br>
When programmed with a call signal, the cat-doorbell will ring the bell after motion is detected within a 1.5 minutes window.<br>
The idea is that a human with "good intentions" would most likely have pressed the regular clicker within the time frame. A cat would most likely hang around until someone opens the door.

## Usage
Hold down button until status led blinks. You now have 5 seconds to push your regular doorbell clicker. The status led will blink multiple times if it times out and once if it succeeded.<br>
